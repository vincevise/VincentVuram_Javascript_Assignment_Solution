# Typing Speed Test Application

<a href="https://vincevise.github.io/VincentVuram_Javascript_Assignment_Solution/">Live Website</a>

Create a Simple Typing speed application in JavaScript.

The application should have some dummy text which the user will type
character by character.And the time limit for a user to do the typing test will be 60 seconds.

The dummy text should be displayed over the html page and the page
should also have an input box or area to take the input from the user and
analyze the input based on the dummy text displayed.

If the user enters a different character as compared to dummy text, that will
be considered as an error and it will affect the accuracy of the userâ€™s typing
skills.

You should be able to provide the dummy text to the user for a given
amount of time.You may repeat the text after a point of time.

The above given images show a demo page. Which initials shows the Errors
,total time for typing and the accuracy attributes.

Below that It shows some text where the dummy text will be displayed.
Below it is a input box ,when user clicks on the input box the test gets
started and dummy text will be displayed above the input box.

After the given time elapsed ,page should display some attributes like :

WordPerMinute(WPM) (count of the words typed by
user)

CharacterPerMinute(count of the characters typed by the
user)

Errors(Wrong characters typed by the user),time elapsed (it will be 0 at
this phase of game) 

Accuracy(Correct characters typed / total count of
characters in the dummy text *100). 

## Important instructions
i) You should use only JavaScript ,HTML and Css for the project.

ii) You may use the Css as per your choice but the given functionalities
should be satisfied by the code.

iii) It should follow proper naming convention

iv) Functionalities should be achieved with specific methods.
